Planning Parties with Pretty Planes

This project was to design a program to organize a group of 100 or less employees from 16 different companies with each company having no more than 10 representatives. All of these company representatives are seated in 10 tables each with 10 seats with the condition that each table must not consist of two individuals from the same company in order to promote exchange of ideas and communication with different people. In addition, to a method creating such an arrangement, the program must allow the user to add registrants to the list of employees, given that all of the previous rules are still followed, and must also add functionality to allow the seating configuration to be printed by company, by table, or by individual based on the user's choice. While the details and numbers may sound very specific, our objective is to create a program as general as possible that can achieve all objectives while remaining within the rules and being able to be reused for future events of similar but slightly different specific numbers and conditions.
